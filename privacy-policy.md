Masamarka Privacy Policy

Introduction
Masamarka ("we" or "us") is a restaurant ordering application (for QR code orders, kiosk orders, or dine-in orders) that respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our app and related services. We are committed to safeguarding your data and ensuring compliance with applicable data protection laws, including the Turkish Law on Protection of Personal Data (KVKK). By using Masamarka, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

Information We Collect

Personal Information:
 When you use Masamarka, we may collect the following personal information from you:
Name and Surname:
 The name you provide (note: we do not require official ID verification, so this can be a nickname or initials as you prefer).
Phone Number:
 Collected for account verification and order communication (e.g., to send one-time passwords for login).
Email Address:
 (If provided) used for account creation, receipts, or support contact.
We do 
not
 collect or process any sensitive personal 
data
 (such as race, religion, health, biometric 
data
, etc.) Please do not share any sensitive personal information through our app.

Order Information:
 If you place an order through Masamarka, we will collect details about your order (such as the items, order time, and any special instructions). This information is used to process your order and is linked to your account but typically does not include additional personal identifiers beyond the profile data you provide.

Usage Data:
 We currently do not use any advanced tracking techniques. We do not collect precise location data or any unnecessary device information. We may log basic technical details (such as device type or operating system version) purely to ensure compatibility and security of the service, but 
we are not using any analytics tools at this time
. In particular, 
we do not use cookies or analytics tools 
to 
 
collect 
 
personal 
 
data
. Only minimal data (such as a temporary session token) might be stored as needed for the app to function properly.

How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:
Account Creation and Login:
 We use your name, phone number, and email to create and manage your user account. Your phone number is used to send a one-time password (OTP) via WhatsApp for authentication when logging in. This ensures that only you can access your account.
Providing Services:
 We process your personal information to facilitate restaurant orders. For example, your order details are used to inform the restaurant of what you have ordered so they can prepare it. If you are dining in, the restaurant will receive the order linked to your table (and possibly your name if needed for service).
Communication:
 We may use your phone number or email to communicate with you about your orders or account. For instance, we might send order confirmations, updates (like when your order is ready), or respond to customer support inquiries. We will 
not
 send any marketing or promotional messages without your consent.
Service Improvement:
 Internally, we may analyze order trends or feedback in aggregate to improve our services and develop new features. This analysis will not use any personally identifying information, as we currently do not employ any personalized tracking.
Legal Obligations:
 If necessary, we will use your information to comply with legal requirements or to enforce our Terms of Service (for example, using data to prevent fraud or abuse of our platform if ever applicable).

Data Storage and Security

Your personal data is stored securely on our own servers (e.g., in our protected SQL database). We take industry-standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or deletion. These measures include access controls (so only authorized personnel can access the data) and encryption where appropriate. We also monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks to ensure your data remains safe.
Please note that, while we strive to protect your data, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. However, we continually update our security practices to meet or exceed industry standards and to adapt to new threats.
If we become aware of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will notify you and the relevant authorities as required by law.

Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as you maintain an account with Masamarka and as long as it is necessary to provide our services. If you delete your account or request deletion of your data, we will remove or anonymize your personal information within a reasonable time frame, unless we are required to keep it longer to comply with legal obligations. Order records may be kept in anonymized form for business analytics, but those records will no longer be identifiable to you once your personal details are removed.

Sharing of Information and Third Parties

We do 
not
 sell or rent your personal information to any third parties, and we do not share your personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes. In fact, 
we do not share your personal information with third parties at all, except in the following circumstances
:
Service Providers (OTP Delivery via WhatsApp):
 We use WhatsApp (a service provided by Meta Platforms, Inc.) as a third-party service provider to send OTP messages for login verification. This means we share your phone number with WhatsApp 
only
 for the purpose of delivering the one-time login code to you. WhatsApp may process the phone number and message to deliver the OTP, but it is not authorized to use your number for any other purpose on our behalf. Aside from WhatsApp for OTP, we currently do not utilize any external service that requires sharing your personal data.
Restaurant Orders:
 When you place an order at a restaurant through our app, we share the necessary details of that order with the restaurant. This will typically include the items ordered and possibly your first name or an identifier to ensure the restaurant can fulfill your order correctly. We limit the information shared to what is needed to prepare and service your order. Restaurants are expected to handle your information in accordance with applicable privacy standards and only use it for order fulfillment.
Legal Requirements:
 If we are compelled by law, regulation, court order, or government authority to disclose your personal information, we may do so to the extent we are required. We will only share what is legally necessary and, if permitted, we will inform you of such disclosure.
Protection of Rights and Safety:
 If necessary to enforce our terms and policies, to investigate or defend against legal claims, or to prevent fraud or security issues, we may disclose information to appropriate authorities or consultants. For example, if required to prevent harm or illegal activities, we might share information with law enforcement.
Business Transfers:
 In the unlikely event that Masamarka is involved in a merger, acquisition, investment, or sale of all or part of its business, personal data may be transferred to the new owners or partners as part of that transaction. If such a transfer occurs, we will ensure that your information remains protected by this Privacy Policy (unless you are notified of changes and consent to them).
Aside from the situations above, 
your information is used exclusively for operating our app and services
. We will always aim to minimize the data we share and will never share more than is necessary for the task at hand.

Cookies and Analytics

Masamarka does not use any cookies, web beacons, or similar tracking technologies on the app or website for analytics or advertising purposes. As noted, 
we do not use cookies or analytics tools to collect personal data
[2]
. The only cookies or local storage mechanisms that might be in use are those essential for the operation of the service (for example, to keep you logged in during a session, if applicable). We currently do not use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or any in-app analytics libraries. If this changes in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and notify you where required, and we will ensure any such tools are disclosed and, if necessary, opt-in by users.

Your Rights and Choices

You have rights regarding your personal data held by Masamarka, and we want to make it easy for you to exercise them. Subject to applicable law (such as KVKK in Turkey or GDPR in applicable jurisdictions), your rights may include:
Access and Portability:
 You can request confirmation of whether we are processing your personal data, and you can ask for a copy of the data we hold about you.
Correction:
 If any personal information we have is incorrect or out-of-date (for example, you wish to update your name or email), you have the right to request a correction. We encourage you to keep your information accurate and up to date.
Deletion:
 You may request deletion of your personal data (the "right to be forgotten"). This includes the option to delete your account. We will delete or anonymize the information not required to retain by law. Keep in mind, if you delete your account, you will lose access to any saved preferences or order history associated with that account.
Objection or Restriction:
 You can object to or ask us to restrict processing of your data in certain circumstances. For example, if you believe we are processing your data beyond the purpose it was collected for, you can object.
Withdrawal of Consent:
 If we ever rely on your consent to process any personal data (for instance, if in the future we ask your consent for promotional communications), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the legality of any processing we already carried out based on your prior consent.
To exercise any of these rights, you can contact us using the information in the "Contact Us" section below. For security, we may need to verify your identity (for example, by confirming you control the email or phone number associated with your account) before fulfilling your request. We will respond to requests within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with applicable law.
Please note that some requests (like deletion or restriction) may prevent us from providing you with certain services – for example, if you delete your account or refuse to provide a 
phone number, you will not be able to log in to place orders. We will inform you if any requested action will have such consequences, so you can make an informed decision.

Children’s Privacy

Masamarka is not directed to individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are under 13, please do not use our app or provide any personal information. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, we will promptly delete it. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used our app and provided personal data, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
(Note: 13 is used as a general minimum age; if local law (KVKK) specifies a different age for consent (e.g., 18 for contracts), the usage of the app should be accordingly limited to adults or minors with parental consent.)

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the "last updated" date at the top of the policy and, if the changes are significant, we may provide a more prominent notice (such as a notification within the app or an email notification). We encourage you to review this Policy periodically. Your continued use of Masamarka after any changes to this Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of those changes.
